### About Dataset
Keras has an inbuilt dataset called fashion mnist and developers use this readily available dataset for immediate
image classification. It consist of 10 classes of fashion wears that could be classified using Neural networks.
It is mostly used for learning purposes and availability. This project covers the classification of these images
using basic artificial neural networks.
### Overview of Image Classification
What do you mean by image classification?
Image classification is the process of categorizing and labeling groups of pixels or vectors within an image based 
on specific rules. The categorization law can be devised using one or more spectral or textural characteristics. 
Two general methods of classification are 'supervised' and 'unsupervised'.
What is image classification with example?
Image classification is where a computer can analyse an image and identify the 'class' the image falls under. 
(Or a probability of the image being part of a 'class'.) A class is essentially a label, for instance, 'car', 'animal',
'building' and so on.In the project, we classified the different kinds of wears in fashion.
